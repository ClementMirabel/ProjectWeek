# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
The overarching goal of this project is to use pre- and intra-operative imaging to help neurosurgeons determine whether gross total resection has been achieved.  The goal for this week is to use 3D Slicer to manually select 10-15 corresponding features in ultrasound images obtained from 10 patients.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Describe **what you plan to achieve** in 1-2 sentences.
1. Objective B. ...
1. Objective C. ...

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. To identify corresponding landmarks or features in 3 sets of 3D ultrasound images acquired during brain tumor resection - one prior to opening of the dura, second after the opening of the dura but prior to resection, and the third during resection.
2. We are using 3D Slicer to visualize, explore, and annotate these landmarks in ultrasound images.
3. All images were acquired using a BK Ultrasound 5000 scanner in the AMIGO suite at BWH.
